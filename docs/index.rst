Pilote 
======
< French for 'Pilot' (noun). Meaning - test (a scheme, project, etc.) before introducing it more widely >


Delivery Partner integration is a very important step in building an ecommerce portal.
We realised the importance of the same and tried creating a layer which would involve less time and resource

Pilote was build to solve the following issues:

- Indigenous Delivery Partner integration 
- Lack of python based sdk's for most of the Delivery Partners
- Reduce the time taken for such integrations

Prior to Pilote , Initially it would have taken something around 2 weeks for a single integration. 
Now it can be done in less than a minute.




Currently we have integrated the following delivery partners:

- Blue Dart
- Delhivery
- Ecom Express

Does it not sound cool enough..!!
Look how easy it is to use:
