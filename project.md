<p>

Fyx is an integration of multiple Delivery partners into a single project. It was created due to the problem faced by
us while integrating various DPS. All the DPS have different payloads and different content types for example Bluedart
uses XML, Delhivery uses JSON. So what is changed now with FYX , you need not worry about the payload type and response
format, you will send and receive JSON.

</p>

<p>
It reduces the time and effort in intgerating a new delivery partner. You will just need to integrate FYX instaead of
many different delivery partners. And you are saved from the errors coming due to payload, content-type issues etc.
It took us 2-3 weeks to onboard each delivery partner but with FYX it will not take more than Five minutes
</p>

<p>
Currently we have integrated three delivery partners Bluedart, Delhivery and Ecomm. We are open for suggestions and more
integrations :)
